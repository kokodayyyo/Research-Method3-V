        "abstract": "This study proposes a Multi-Agent Double Deep Q-Network (MADDQN) framework to optimize financial trading strategies. The framework balances maximum revenue and risk avoidance by employing two different agents representing different time-series feature extraction networks, TimesNet and Multi-Scale CNN. The model is trained on a mixed dataset of major U.S. stock indexes and shows robust performance across different assets.",
